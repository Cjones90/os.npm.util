### Utility Modules

Utility modules used across projects that are standardized in order to keep code
DRY and versioned.

The folder structure is intended to allow files to be flexible enough to be
broken off into their own module and versioned separately and included here.

This is intended to be more of an umbrella repo/module that will keep up-to-date
with each module for simplicities sake if multiple modules are needed.

#### Client
api
Menu

#### Server
auth
service


## TODO
Update the readme
Version each module separately
Start doing LOG_LEVEL type output ie DEBUG, INFO, WARN, etc.

REMOVE ALL ENV VARIABLES AND PASS EVERYTHING VIA CONFIG OPTIONS/CONFIG FILE
The previously convenience is becoming super inconvenient
