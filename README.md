### Utility Modules

Utility modules used across projects that are standardized in order to keep code
DRY and versioned.

The folder structure is intended to allow files to be flexible enough to be
broken off into their own module and versioned separately and included here.

This is intended to be more of an umbrella repo/module that will keep up-to-date
with each module for simplicities sake if multiple modules are needed.
